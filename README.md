# JS REST API

A *very simple* REST API which is used for many demos and posts for my blog.

## What does this API do?

The purpose of this API is to show you comic strips of many comics which is coded. Following comics are available for now:

1. Dilbert
2. Calvin and Hobbes
3. Garfield
4. Peanuts
5. Wizard of Id
6. The Adventures of Business Cat
7. Non Sequitur
8. Pearls Before Swine

This API will return an asset URL which you can embed in your webpage or simply access it for reading the comic strip. It uses web scraping for getting the URL from the page.
